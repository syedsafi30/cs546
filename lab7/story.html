            Earth was going out of crop, peopple where living off paddy and corn. The soil of earth was not reaping anything and I decided to  be the part of people who go into space who sacrificed my family for the sake of people on the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went inside the blackhole and found a new planet which consits of water and soil but the gravity of the planet was inverted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After discovering the planet and I sent back the signal to the love of my life on the planet earth in morse code. The morse code was stored in her laptops backlight camera which blicked accoringly for the people of the earth who later discovered the address to the new found planet.
